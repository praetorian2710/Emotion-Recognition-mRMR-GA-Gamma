# EEG Emotion Classification using Genetic Algorithm-based Feature Selection and Gamma Function-based Dynamic Feature Fusion

This is the official implementation of the paper:

**"EEG Emotion Classification using Genetic Algorithm-based Feature Selection and Gamma Function-based Dynamic Feature Fusion Presented at XXVIII International Conference on Soft Computing and Measurement (SCM'2025)"**

## üß† Overall Workflow

The proposed framework integrates **robust feature selection** with a **dual-branch deep learning model**, fusing the resulting features using a novel **Gamma function-based dynamic fusion mechanism** for highly accurate **EEG-based emotion recognition**.

## üîç Feature Selection: `mRMR + Genetic Algorithm`

To construct an optimal and compact feature set, we apply a two-stage selection process:

- **Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR):**  
  Reduces the initial feature space by selecting features that are highly **relevant** to emotion classes and exhibit **minimal redundancy** among themselves.

- **Genetic Algorithm (GA):**  
  Further optimizes the feature subset using an **evolutionary search** to identify combinations that yield **maximum classification performance**.

## üîó Gamma Function-based Feature Fusion

A novel **Gamma function-based fusion mechanism** is proposed to dynamically combine the features extracted from two parallel branches:

- **ANN Branch**
- **BiLSTM Branch**

The Gamma function assigns **adaptive weights** to the feature vectors, enhancing the most **discriminative features**. The fused vector is then passed to a **fully connected classifier** for final emotion classification.
